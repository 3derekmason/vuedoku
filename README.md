Welcome to **Vuedoku**, a three part story where we build a Sudoku app using Vue3 and configure the logic required to make the puzzle playable.

## About

I have always loved solving (or attempting) sudoku puzzles. The patterns and logic that are implemented in a simple numbers game makes a very satisfying, repeatable challenge.

I thought it would be fun to try to build a very simple Sudoku app, and document some lessons along the way.
